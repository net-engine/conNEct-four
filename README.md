## Task

Your task is to complete the build of a Connect Four game, playable by two local players. The basic project setup is ready to go; the game logic and styling is up to you.

The game rules are as follows:
- Each player fills one cell per turn
- Cells can only be filled from the bottom up
- The first player to fill four cells in a row wins

Our talented designer Chelsea has provided a mockup of the game board for you to implement: https://www.figma.com/file/sbHETq8VzYKpJurGBTrHhs/Connect-four

Animations are not expected, and any other UI components can be styled as you see fit.

## Constraints

Please don't swap out the technologies used â€“ however you may add external packages provided the game logic is written by you. Feel free to organise and alter the contents of the `src` folder as you wish.

Please don't spend more than 3 hours completing the task. Remember that well written and organised logic is valued more highly than a complete, but rushed game.

## Setup

Technologies used:
- Node v11 (other versions may be compatible)
- React 16.8 - utilising hooks, JSX
- TypeScript
- SCSS


1. Run `npm i` to install the required modules.
2. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
3. Visit `http://localhost:1234`.

Your changes should be updated automatically in the browser.

If you run into any build issues, try running `npm run clear-cache` to clear the parcel cache.

## Submission

Please zip up your finished project and email it to `adam@netengine.com.au`.
